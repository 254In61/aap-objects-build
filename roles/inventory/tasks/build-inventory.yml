# NB! After this you will need to get into the inventory on GUI and populate it with hosts


## How do we build a smart inventory??

- name: "Create inventory = {{ inventory_name }}"
  ansible.controller.inventory:
    name: "{{ inventory_name }}"
    description: "{{ inventory_name }} inventory"
    organization: "{{ organization_name }}"
    state: present
    #controller_config_file: "~/tower_cli.cfg"
